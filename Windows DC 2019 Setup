###
Windows Server 2019 Standard installation on 
  1) 1 CPU 
  2) 2GB ram 
  3) 60GB Hard disk
  
Started with vmware tools installation and changing the dynamic ip to static ip of 172.16.0.10 and main Gateway at 172.16.0.254. 
Later i changed the name of the machine to MAINDC and restarted the VM for the settings to take affect. When the vM boots again
we need to add the role of Domain Controller on this VM. Go to Server Manager >> Manage (TOP RIGHT) >> Add roles and Features. 
Add the Domain Controller feature and let it restart the VM if required.

Now we need to promote this VM to Domain Controller with the following Powershell script:-
          #
          # Windows PowerShell script for AD DS Deployment
          #

          Import-Module ADDSDeployment
          Install-ADDSForest `
          -CreateDnsDelegation:$false `
          -DatabasePath "C:\Windows\NTDS" `
          -DomainMode "WinThreshold" `
          -DomainName "cyborenics.local" `
          -DomainNetbiosName "EXAMPLE" `
          -ForestMode "WinThreshold" `
          -InstallDns:$true `
          -LogPath "C:\Windows\NTDS" `
          -NoRebootOnCompletion:$false `
          -SysvolPath "C:\Windows\SYSVOL" `
          -Force:$true
          
    Remember the domain name is EXAMPLE.local 
    
This process of promoting this VM to DC wil require a restart of the VM to save any unsaved tasks adn wait for it to complete 
and reboot the VM.
